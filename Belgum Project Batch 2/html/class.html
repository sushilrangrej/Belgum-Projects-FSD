    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>

    <p class="red">
        HTML is a set of codes and symbols that are inserted into a file to be displayed on the internet. These codes, or tags, tell web browsers how to display images and words on a web page.

    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, a computer language that controls how HTML elements are displayed on a screen, in print, or on other media. CSS can be used to design the layout of web pages, and can even control the layout of multiple web pages at once.
